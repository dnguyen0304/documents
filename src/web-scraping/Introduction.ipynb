    "**What is web scraping?** Programmatically fetching and then extracting data from web pages by relying on the semi-predictability of HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should web scraping be used?** To obtain data when the server does not provide a public API, exports (e.g. CSV), or database access. These options are listed starting with the most desirable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When should web scraping be used?** Some data is formatted conveniently as a table and may be manually “scraped” with Copy + Paste. Other information such as [flight fares on Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/flights/BOS-DCA/2017-03-04-flexible) is formatted horizontally or distributed throughout the page. Web scraping is at least even with database access because it is also highly unreliable and maintenance-intensive. At this tier, there are no guarantees from the developers. They may introduce backward-incompatible changes to the data model or HTML document at any time without notice. Manual labor is often more accurate and cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say implementing web scraping is inherently a poor decision. Rather one should be particularly thoughtful. In some circumstances, web scraping is the best and even only viable option.\n",
